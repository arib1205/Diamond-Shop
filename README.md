# Diamond-Shop
To run this project you need to do the following

1) Download SQLite.
    Link : http://sqlitebrowser.org
    
2)Download sqlite-jdbc, though I have provided the file in the project, it is better to download it and add it to the referenced libraries of the project

3) I have provided the database file logindb.db which can be opened using SQLite

4)The path where you store the databased file logindb.db is important. This path has to be specified in the code of database.java file in the project. I have saved the path as "jdbc:sqlite:C:\\Users\\aribp\\Desktop\\Projects\\logindb.db" . You need to change the path according to your location.

5)You are good to go now. Select the intro.java file and run it.

//I use NetBeans or Eclipse for my project, You can use whichever IDE you like.//
